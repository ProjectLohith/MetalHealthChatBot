# ✅ Mental Health Chatbot – AI-Powered Emotional Support System
This project is an AI-based chatbot designed to offer conversational support, information, and guidance around mental health topics. It simulates a compassionate virtual assistant that users can interact with in a private and safe environment.

**🔍 Key Highlights:**

💬 Offers supportive dialogue to users facing emotional stress or mental health concerns.

🤖 Trained a deep learning model on customized intents dataset (intents.json) using TensorFlow/Keras, enabling the chatbot to classify queries and respond appropriately.

🧠 Also integrated a version with OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo for intelligent, contextual responses.

🧪 Uses model.h5 (custom trained) and NLP preprocessing artifacts (texts.pkl, labels.pkl) for traditional model inference.

📁 Backend logic powered by Flask, with conversational flow managed through app.py.

**📄 Project Structure Includes:**

training.py — Model training pipeline

intents.json & intentsP.json — Predefined conversational intents

model.h5 — Trained neural network model

app.py — Chat interface logic via Flask

templates/, static/ — UI built with HTML/CSS for a basic web interface

**🛠 Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenAI GPT-3.5, Streamlit (for another variant), HTML/CSS

**🎯 What It Demonstrates:** NLP-based intent classification, backend development, Flask-based REST interaction, and AI integration.
